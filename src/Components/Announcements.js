          Join us for an evening of nostalgia, reconnecting with old friends,
          and networking with fellow alumni who have gone on to achieve
          remarkable success in their respective fields. This event is an
          excellent opportunity to reminisce about the good times spent at NNSF
          and to hear about the exciting journeys our alumni have embarked upon
          since graduation.
